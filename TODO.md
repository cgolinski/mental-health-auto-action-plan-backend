## To Do

## Questions

- How do I delete the extra branch I pushed to heroku? Only want heroku to have master.
- When I log the keys of process.env locally
  - Why doesn’t include process.env.NODE_ENV?
  - Why does it include “npm_config\_\_roche_registry”.
- Is heroku automatically seen as process.env.NODE_ENV=“production”?
