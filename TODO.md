## TO DO

### DEFECTS

### FEATURES

### TECH DEBT

- Delete the extra branch I pushed to heroku. Only want heroku to have master.

### QUESTIONS

- When I log the keys of process.env locally

  - Why doesn’t include process.env.NODE_ENV?
  - Why does it include “npm_config\_\_roche_registry”.

- Is heroku automatically seen as process.env.NODE_ENV=“production”?
